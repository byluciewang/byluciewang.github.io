notes

Haha, like barak like Obama, um. Hopefully I want to bold with that, but I like helping people and making websites is one of my strong suits. Ok so my big goal is make a good life for me and the people I love and that to me that means growing connecting my community, being active and eating healthy, and finding opportunities to improve the lives of people around me in meaningful ways. Like making them a website, or helping them move, or babysitting, little or big things that help.
